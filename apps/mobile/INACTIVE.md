# Mobile App - INACTIVE

⚠️ **This mobile application is currently INACTIVE and not being used.**

## Status
- This folder contains a scaffolded React Native/Expo mobile app
- It is NOT being built or deployed
- It is ignored during Vercel deployments via `.vercelignore`

## Purpose
This was intended as a mobile companion app for the DesignCraft screenshot editing tool, but is currently not in active development.

## If You Want to Activate It
1. Remove the mobile app from `.vercelignore` in the root directory
2. Set up a separate deployment pipeline for the mobile app (Expo EAS, etc.)
3. Complete the implementation in `src/app/index.jsx`

## Current Setup
- Framework: Expo v53
- React Native: v0.79.3
- Router: Expo Router v5.1.0
- Status: Scaffolded but not implemented

**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Reason for Inactivity:** Preventing deployment conflicts with Vercel web app
